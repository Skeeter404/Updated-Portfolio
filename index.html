        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="about-para">My name is Bronson Bird. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. I spent most of my adult life trying to find my place in the financial industry. Mostly because I started working for a financial institution and decided that it would be a good place to have a career. Though for some reason, it didn't feel like I was being true to myself or to my interests.</p>
        <p class="about-para">I have always had a love for computers, the web, and what makes them work. Because of this, I found myself exploring different career fields that seemed more in line with the things that fascinated me. That's when I became intrigued by the world of coding and web development. At that point, I decided to dive in and enroll myself into a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Utah.</p>

        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="about-para">I definitely have a wide variety of things that I enjoy doing... almost all of those things include my family and friends. At a young age, I found a love for video games, music, sports, and art. These things fueled my desire to learn as much as possible about as many things as possible.</p>
        <p class="about-para">In my opinion, my love for video games is what got me started on my education in Computer Science. Though it's not very expansive, I learned enough to figure out what it took to build my own PC when I was a teenager, and then educate myself from there. My love for music and art is what pushed me towards the idea of Coding and Web Development. The idea of creating something amazing, for potentially millions of people, was incredibly exciting for me.</p>
