      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p class="about-para">My name is Bronson Bird. I have always had a love for computers, the web, and what makes
        them work. Because of this, I found myself exploring different career fields that seemed more in line with the things that fascinated me.
        That's when I became intrigued by the world of coding and web development. At that point, I decided to dive in
        and enroll myself into a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Utah. The idea of creating something
        amazing, for potentially millions of people, was incredibly exciting for me.</p>

      <h3>Experience</h3>

      <p class="about-para">Enrolling in the Coding Bootcamp gave me a ton of experience in Full Stack Development. I
        learned everything needed to create amazing web pages using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Node, Express, Handlebars, SQL, MongoDB, and React; As well as introduced me
        to fantastic libraries on the web, such as Bootstrap, and Materialize. </p>
