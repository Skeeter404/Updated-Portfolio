# Updated-Portfolio

I am making this new repository so that I can create a new portfolio in order to showcase the skills that I have obtained, and furthered since making my original portfolio. My hope is to give a little bit of insight into my personal life, my personality, and my hobbies. As well as, show off some of the projects that I have completed since starting my education in Coding and Web Development. 
Creating this portfolio is going to be done using mostly basic html and css. However, I will also be using either Bootstrap or Materialize, along with the javascript that is associated them.
